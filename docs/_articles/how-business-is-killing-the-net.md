When Red Hat Inc., a Linux packager, recently entered the IPO ring, shareware enthusiasts weren't sure whether to reel in horror or celebrate. A free, open-source operating system, Linux owes its very existence to volunteers working outside the commercial sphere. Now that the software's leading distributor had joined forces with Goldman Sachs to offer common stock to NASDAQ speculators, it appeared at first glance that freeware's ultimate weapon against the Microsoft empire had been surrendered to the forces of capitalism.

This development was especially startling to those who consider Linux the paragon of the internet's spirit of cooperation. Created by hundreds of programmers working in tandem online, the success of Linux sent a message to the increasingly business-focused net community: Collaborating toward common goals yields better technology than competing for market share.

The last few years of stunted development online have proven this to be true. Since the net went commercial, there hasn't been a single innovation worthy of the name. Except for speeds and feeds, the development of networking technologies has come to a dead stop. It may even be going backward.

A significant thing about Linux is that its development process harkens back to the good old days of the early seventies when using a computer meant learning to share. People didn't have computers of their own; there _were_ no personal computers. At best, users had access to terminals that were linked to a mainframe housed in a government or university facility. As a result, almost all innovations in networking technology had to do with helping people cooperate.

More to the point, the folks behind these innovations were less concerned with making money than with growing the technology itself. Most programs were developed at non-profit institutions like universities and distributed as shareware because their authors wanted them to spread. Their motive wasn't purely altruistic. The developers believed that each programming innovation represented a better way of doing things, and wanted the rest of the computing universe to conform to their vision of good technology.

Though today NASDAQ investors like to take credit for making the net flourish, in reality every major internet application we think of as coming from Redmond or Silicon Valley is just a fatter, clunkier, less efficient version of something first developed as shareware. Eudora, the email program that served as the model for Microsoft's Outlook Express, originated as freeware from the University of Illinois. Sure, the latest versions--backed by millions in development dollars--may be capable of displaying pictures within the message text, but that mostly serves the needs of online merchants wishing to graphically showcase their wares. For most of us, it only makes the downloading of spam take a whole lot longer.

Internet Explorer is a sub-par rip-off of Netscape Navigator, which is merely the commercial version of Mosaic--a browser originally developed by then University of Illinois student Marc Andreessen. The World Wide Web itself was established by an international consortium of scientists and researchers looking for a way to index and footnote each another's documents through hyperlinks. Today's browsers, which hog up to fifteen megs of hard drive space and countless more in RAM, don't do anything the shareware ones couldn't except through plug-ins--which, for the most part, were themselves shareware utilities before being bought by AOL, Microsoft or Netscape.

Even RealAudio and other streaming media are shareware knock-offs. PC-based video- conferencing over the net was first devised by staff techies at Cornell University in the mid- eighties. CUSeeMe, distributed for free, made the great conceptual leap forward; everything since then has been merely an incremental improvement on this work--except that most of CUSeeMe's successors are broadcasting technologies and don't allow for two-way communication. Big improvement.

The notion that computing gets better through competition rather than cooperation even permeates the conventional wisdom about how the internet came to be. The net's development has long been attributed to that other ruthless and fiercely competitive force: the military. The U.S. Department of Defense
