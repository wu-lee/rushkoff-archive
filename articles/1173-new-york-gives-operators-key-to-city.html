            <p>The city’s lampposts will provide more than just light, thanks to a new deal with a number of wireless companies.</p>
            <p>In an agreement reported to be worth $25 million a year to the city, New York has agreed to allow a consortium of six wireless industry companies install much-needed transmitters on lamp posts throughout the five boroughs.</p>
            <p>Nextel and T-Mobile are the two cellular providers involved in the deal, and have teamed up with Wi-Fi and VoIP providers ClearLinx Network, Crown Castle, Dianet and IDT Business Services.</p>
            <p>Local coverage has focused on the possible health threats caused by increased radiation. But expect the story to unfold a bit differently as residents learn what plans may have been rejected by the city in favor of this one – such as ripping up the street to lay down new cable – as well as which operators were behind them.</p>
            <p>Where do giants Verizon and Cingular stand on this? Given the history of wireless in the city, it may just take a lawsuit is filed to find out.</p>
            <p>But with the number of NYC’s cell users having passed the 4 million mark last year, nobody would want to be on the side that’s denying anyone their coverage.</p>
