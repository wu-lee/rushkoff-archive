            <p>We don’t need to credit an all-seeing God with the creation of life and matter to suspect that something wonderfully strange is going on in the dimension we call reality. Most of us living in it feel invested with a sense of purpose. Whether this directionality is a genuine, preexisting condition of the universe, an illusion perpetrated by DNA, or something that will one day emerge from social interaction has yet to be determined. At the very least, this means our experience and expectations of life can no longer be dismissed as impediments to proper observation and analysis.</p>
            <p>But science’s unearned commitment to materialism has led us into convoluted assumptions about the origins of spacetime, in which time itself simply must be accepted as a by-product of the Big Bang, and consciousness (if it even exists) as a by- product of matter. Such narratives follow information on its continuing evolution toward complexity, the Singularity, and robot consciousness–a saga no less apocalyptic than the most literal interpretations of biblical prophecy.</p>
            <p>It’s entirely more rational–and less steeped in storybook logic–to work with the possibility that time predates matter and that consciousness is less the consequence of a physical cause-and-effect reality than a precursor.</p>
            <p>By starting with Godlessness as a foundational principle of scientific reasoning, we make ourselves unnecessarily resistant to the novelty of human consciousness, its potential continuity over time, and the possibility that it has purpose.</p>
